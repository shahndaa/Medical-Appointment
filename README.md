Medical Appointment No-Shows Dataset
This dataset contains information about medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on why patients miss their scheduled appointments. It's a valuable resource for analyzing factors influencing patient attendance and potentially building predictive models to reduce no-show rates.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes various patient attributes, appointment details, and indicators of whether a patient showed up for their appointment. Each row represents a single appointment.

Columns Description
Here's a breakdown of the columns in the dataset:

patientid: Unique identifier for each patient.

appointmentid: Unique identifier for each appointment.

gender: Gender of the patient (Male or Female).

scheduledday: The day the appointment was scheduled. This is a timestamp.

appointmentday: The actual day of the appointment. This is a timestamp, but often truncated to the date.

age: Age of the patient.

neighbourhood: The location where the appointment takes place.

scholarship: Indicates whether the patient is enrolled in the Bolsa Familia government welfare program (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

hipertension: Indicates if the patient has hypertension (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

diabetes: Indicates if the patient has diabetes (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

alcoholism: Indicates if the patient is an alcoholic (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

handcap: Indicates the number of disabilities the patient has.

sms_received: Indicates if the patient received SMS messages (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

no_show: The target variable. 'No' means the patient showed up for the appointment. 'Yes' means the patient did not show up.

Potential Use Cases
This dataset can be used for:

Predictive Modeling: Building models to predict whether a patient will miss their appointment.

Feature Engineering: Creating new variables from existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., waiting time, day of the week, previous no-shows).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding trends and relationships between different factors and appointment no-shows.

Healthcare Insights: Identifying key demographic, health, or scheduling factors that contribute to missed appointments, which can inform strategies to improve patient attendance.
